#
# Deploy to Azure — Builds and deploys the app to Azure App Service on every
# push to main (i.e., after a PR merges).
#
# Flow:
#   1. Push lands on main (direct or via merged PR)
#   2. Restore, build, and publish the .NET app in Release configuration
#   3. Deploy the published output to Azure App Service using the publish profile
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE secret containing the App Service publish profile XML
#
# Safety:
#   - Concurrency group ensures only one deploy runs at a time; newer pushes
#     cancel in-progress deploys (safe because we always deploy HEAD of main)
