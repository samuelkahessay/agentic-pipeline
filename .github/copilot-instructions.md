# Copilot Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This repository is an **autonomous GitHub development pipeline** powered by
[gh-aw](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) (GitHub Agentic Workflows). It turns
Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into implemented code via AI agents:

1. **You write a PRD** and push it to `docs/prd/`, or paste it in an issue
2. **`prd-decomposer`** — AI reads the PRD, creates GitHub Issues with
   acceptance criteria
3. **`repo-assist`** — AI picks up issues, writes code, opens draft PRs
4. **`pr-reviewer`** — Automated review approves or requests changes
5. **`pipeline-status`** — Daily dashboard tracks progress

Human role: write PRDs, review PRs, merge.

## Agentic Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `prd-decomposer` | `/decompose` command | Parses PRD → creates issues |
| `repo-assist` | Daily + `/repo-assist` | Implements issues → opens PRs |
| `pipeline-status` | Daily | Updates progress dashboard issue |
| `pr-reviewer` | PR opened/updated | AI-powered code review |

## Pipeline Issue Lifecycle
1. `prd-decomposer` creates issues with `[Pipeline]` prefix and `pipeline` label
2. Issues include acceptance criteria, dependencies (`Depends on #N`), and
   type labels (`feature`, `test`, `infra`, `docs`, `bug`)
3. `repo-assist` picks up issues in dependency order, creates branches
   (`repo-assist/issue-<N>-<desc>`), implements code, and opens draft PRs
4. `pr-reviewer` auto-reviews pipeline PRs, approves or requests changes
5. On approval, auto-merge is enabled; on merge, the linked issue auto-closes
   via `Closes #N`
6. `repo-assist` re-dispatches to pick up the next issue

## PR Conventions
- Title prefix: `[Pipeline]` for all agent-created PRs
- Body must contain `Closes #N` referencing the source issue
- PRs include AI disclosure: "This PR was created by Pipeline Assistant."
- All tests must pass before the PR is approved
- Labels: `automation`, `pipeline`

## Labels
| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pipeline` | Pipeline-managed issue |
| `feature` | New feature implementation |
| `test` | Test coverage |
| `infra` | Infrastructure / scaffolding |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `bug` | Bug fix |
| `automation` | Created by automation |
| `in-progress` | Work in progress |
| `blocked` | Blocked by dependency |
| `ready` | Ready for implementation |
| `completed` | Completed and merged |
| `report` | Status report |

## Working with This Repo
- **Read `AGENTS.md` first** for project-specific coding standards and build
  commands — the application code evolves as the pipeline implements PRDs
- **Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh`** to set up labels and compile workflows
- **Compile workflows** after editing any `.md` workflow file:
  `gh aw compile`
- **Do not modify** `.github/workflows/*.lock.yml` files directly — they are
  generated by `gh aw compile`
- **Do not modify** `.github/workflows/*.yml` files (standard Actions
  workflows) unless explicitly instructed

## Restrictions
- **Never edit** `.github/workflows/*.lock.yml` — these are generated by `gh aw compile`
- **Never edit** `.github/workflows/*.yml` (standard Actions workflows) unless explicitly asked
- `.github/workflows/*.md` (agentic workflow sources) **may** be edited, but always run `gh aw compile` after
- Do not add dependencies without noting in PR
- Do not refactor code outside the scope of the assigned issue
- Do not change dependency versions without explicit instruction
- Do not merge your own PRs
