  "notes": "Run 04. #125, #126, #137 merged. PR #141 (#127) has REQUEST_CHANGES from review but all code criteria pass — Vercel deployment failure is unrelated to .NET code. New PRs submitted for #140 (CI workflow) and #128 (Classification Service). TicketDtos.cs added in both #128 PR and PR #141 — merge conflict expected but trivial. Next: after #128 merges, implement #129."
